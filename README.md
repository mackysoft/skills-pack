SkillsPack is a .NET global tool for distributing reusable Agent Skills to supported agent hosts.

Use it when the same curated skill set should be shared across repositories or user environments without copying `SKILL.md` files by hand.
The package includes canonical skill definitions, generated host-specific skill files, and commands for listing, exporting, installing, updating, diagnosing, and uninstalling skills.

## Install

```bash
dotnet tool install --global MackySoft.SkillsPack
```

Update the tool to receive the latest bundled skills:

```bash
dotnet tool update --global MackySoft.SkillsPack
```

## Quick Start

List available skills and supported hosts:

```bash
skills-pack skills list
```

Install the development skill category into the current repository:

```bash
skills-pack skills install --host openai --scope project --repo-root . --category development
```

Install the writing skill for the current user:

```bash
skills-pack skills install --host openai --scope user --skill writing
```

Preview changes before writing files:

```bash
skills-pack skills install --host openai --scope project --repo-root . --category development --dry-run --print-diff
```

Check installed project skills:

```bash
skills-pack skills doctor --host openai --scope project --repo-root . --category development
```

| `writing` | `basic` | Write, revise, review, summarize, and localize natural-language text while preserving meaning and structure. |
| `xml-doc-writer` | `development` | Write contract-focused XML documentation comments. |

## Categories

SkillsPack includes these categories:

| Category | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `basic` | Foundational reusable skills. |
| `development` | Code, review, test, Git, and pull request workflow skills. |

## Skill Selection

`--category` selects one or more bundled skill categories.
`--skill` selects exact `skillName` values.
Selectors accept comma-separated values:

```bash
skills-pack skills install --host openai --scope project --repo-root . --category basic,development
skills-pack skills install --host openai --scope project --repo-root . --skill changelog,commit
```

`skills list` can run without selectors.
For `export`, `install`, `update`, `doctor`, and `uninstall`, at least one package selector is required: `--category` or `--skill`.

When both `--category` and `--skill` are specified, selected skills must match the selected categories.
Exact skill selections also include transitive dependencies declared by the selected skills.
For example, selecting `pr-merge` also exports or installs the Git and PR workflow skills it invokes.
